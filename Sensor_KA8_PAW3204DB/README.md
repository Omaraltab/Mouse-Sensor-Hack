## Content

I bought several cheap mouses from Ebay and all the sensors seems to have "KA8" written on it... After researches, it seems that it correspond to the chip PAWW3204DB. 
Most website show only the 5 first pages of the datasheet, you can find the complete one here : http://www.icpdf.com/PIXART_datasheet/PAW3204DB_pdf_7295136/PAW3204DB_1.html

It seem that we can't visualize the camera pixel on this chip... So for now we will only play with motions datas.
